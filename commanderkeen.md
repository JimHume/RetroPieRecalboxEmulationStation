(TODO)

Getting Commander Keen configured in RetroPie involves setting up all the appropriate folder structures with the game files in each subfolder:
e.g.
- keen1\
    * `*.ck1`
    * `keen1.exe`

Note that Keen 1-5 are easy to come by (I have quite a few purchased copies) but Keen 6 is ridiculously difficult to pin down.
If using the incorrect version of Keen6.exe, not only will things like switches / floor traps not work in Keen 6 ("Aliens Ate My Babysitter!"), but it will also cause the community made Comamnder Keen 7-9 games to not work properly (although CK7 might be based on CK4. This is especially frustrating in CK9 because the very last level is virtually unplayable.


TODO:
1. List the actual folder locations
2. Add the "Ports" aspect of cgenius
